## Covid-19 Vaccination Analysis With Country

In this Jupyter IPython Notebook, I have tried to analyze Covid-19 vaccination as per different countries around the world. I have analyzed different countries' vaccine data and showed it on a world map- like which country is taking which vaccine (or, how many vaccines/what combination of vaccines each country is using to fight covid-19). The raw dataset is collected from Kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress

Explanatory details are provided at every step inside the notebook file.

**Libraries Used-** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
